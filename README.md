Projects developed during my academic career - TCC

The configuration of the software is usually the first part to be performed to make the correct use of an application. However, detailed configurations take time for the App to get your way, this fact is detrimental when there is a need to uninstall and reinstall the software since it is necessary to configure everything again. With our software we intend to reverse this scenario, those who wish to be productive and still work in a way that does not lose the comfort of their settings will be able to do so. With this idea, we plan to save our users time that is spent configuring complex applications. We express our intention through our motto "configured once, use forever". keywords: Configurations, Applications, Java
